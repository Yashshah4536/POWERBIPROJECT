## Overview

This project aims to create an interactive and visually appealing HR dashboard using **Microsoft Power BI**. The dashboard provides insights into employee data, diversity metrics, and other relevant HR analytics. Here's what each file in the repository represents:

1. **`myPowerBiProject.pbix`**: This is the Power BI project file. It contains the visualizations, data connections, and interactive elements that make up the HR dashboard. You can open this file in Power BI Desktop to explore and customize the dashboard.

2. **`HRDataset.csv`**: The raw data file. It includes employee-related information such as names, departments, salaries, gender, and other relevant attributes. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis.

3. **`black 1.png`**: An image file used as part of the dashboard design. You can replace this image with any other relevant visuals or company branding elements.

4. **`myPowerBiProject.pdf`**: A PDF export of the final HR dashboard. This file is useful for sharing the dashboard with stakeholders who don't have access to Power BI.
